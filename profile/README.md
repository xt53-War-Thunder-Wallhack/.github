## 🔍 What Is the Wallhack in War Thunder?

The wallhack cheat allows you to **see enemy units through obstacles** such as:

* Buildings 🏢
* Terrain and hills ⛰️
* Trees and foliage 🌲
* Smoke clouds 💨
* Water surfaces 🌊

It works by rendering a custom overlay around enemy vehicles, letting you track them no matter where they hide. Combine that with aim support or radar and you’ve got a complete domination tool 🔥.
